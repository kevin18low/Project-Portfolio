# My Personal Project: Snake

**Functionality**

The application will be a version of the classic game snake. The rules are as follows:

- The game starts with the snake as just one block
- There is one piece of 'food' on the board
- Moving the snake to the square with the food will eat it, and grow the snake by 1
- The goal is to grow your snake until there are no empty squares left

**Users**

Anybody can play snake. Once they understand the rules anyone can play the game for pure enjoyment.

I chose to pursue this project because I used to play snake a lot when I 
was younger. I was never good enough to beat the game, especially since I 
was just a child. In terms of programming, I think this could be a very fun 
project to work on technically and visually. I've always found games interesting
because I could never comprehend how someone could program games that seem
so complex, so I'm hoping to be able to make a working version of this classic
game and also make some customizations to make it more interesting.

**Instructions for grader**
- Run main
- Pressing 'player list' will bring you to the tab of players (X) in the playerbase (Y). This can also
- be done by clicking on the 'players' tab on the left.
- In the players tab, you can sort the players alphabetically by clicking the sort button.
- You can also remove players. You click 'remove' next to the player, and then click save. Clicking refresh will
- show the newe playerbase with the player removed. The player only gets removed if you click save.
- Pressing start from the home screen will lead you to the game setup. If you were on the players tab, click the
- 'game' tab to return to the starting screen.
- Press start
- Type in your desired username. You can check the player list to see if your name is in use.
**New player instructions**
- If you are a new player, click 'New Player' once you've typed your name.
- If you are a new player, you will obviously only be able to start a new game.
- Once you click 'New Game,' enter the desired tile size and snake color. Note: a bigger tile size means bigger tiles
- and a smaller game board. Note: make sure to enter a java recognized color. Some colors like 'purple' are not
- actually Color objects
- Press 'Go!' once you've filled out the fields. Press 'Start game' to start the game.
**Returning player instructions**
- If you are already in the player base, type your name and click 'Returning Player'.
- You have the choice to load a saved game or start or a new one.
- To start a new one, follow the steps mentioned above.
- To load a saved game, press 'Load Game'. Your game data will be displayed brielfy at the bottom of the screen.
- Press 'Start game' in the top right. Be careful, your game starts right away.
**Game saving**
- At any point during the game, you can click 'Save' at the top of the screen to save your current game data.
- Pausing the game first and then saving is recommended.
- At any time, click 'Pause' to pause and unpause the game.
- Once your game is saved, you may close the game and your game data will be saved. You may also continue playing,
- but note that if you lose your saved game will reset.
- If you continue to play after saving, you can pause at any time and close the window. Your old saved game will

**Phase 4: Task 3**

In my program, many of my classes have lots of fields. This was pretty troublesome during the project, as they were
hard to keep track of and often when I made changes they were left unused, and sometimes I forgot to delete them.
One thing I would do is try to make some of those fields into local variables, or pass them as parameters into methods
that I need them for. Another thing I would do is implement the Singleton pattern for my playerbase. There is only ever
one playerbase, and every player added to it must be unique to play the game. The singleton pattern would help to make
my code easier to use. One last thing is that maybe I could try to move some methods to other classes. Some of my
classese got really long and filled with methods, so exporting them would help with ease of use.
