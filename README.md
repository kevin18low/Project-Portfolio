# My Personal Project: Snake

**Functionality**

The application will be a version of the classic game snake. The rules are as follows:

- The game starts with the snake as just one block
- There is one piece of 'food' on the board
- Moving the snake to the square with the food will eat it, and grow the snake by 1
- The goal is to grow your snake until there are no empty squares left

**Users**

Anybody can play snake. Once they understand the rules anyone can play the game for pure enjoyment.

I chose to pursue this project because I used to play snake a lot when I 
was younger. I was never good enough to beat the game, especially since I 
was just a child. In terms of programming, I think this could be a very fun 
project to work on technically and visually. I've always found games interesting
because I could never comprehend how someone could program games that seem
so complex, so I'm hoping to be able to make a working version of this classic
game and also make some customizations to make it more interesting.
